Overture 1.2.5 Release Notes - 25/09/2013
=========================================


What's New in Overture 1.2.5?
-----------------------------

This is a bugfix update primarily that includes documentation and
small language updates on the user-facing side.

It is our intent that this will be the final release in the Overture
version 1.2.x line.  All future development will moslty take place on
the version 2 line, starting with version 2.0.0, which will be
released almost concurrently with this release.


System Requirements
-------------------

Overture is based on the Eclipse platform. To run it, you must have a
Java runtime system installed, version 6 or later.


Downloading
-----------

Overture can be downloaded from the SourceForge site.

Documentation, including download instructions, tutorials and a
language manual, are available from the Overture portal site.


Installing
----------

The download file is a ZIP archive. To install the tool, unzip the
file in a convenient location. The main executable is in the top level
directory, called OvertureIde.

For 32-bit Windows users, it is possible to use the Overture installer
which can be found in SourceForge.

Upgrading:
* ATTENTION: If you are using the ZIP archive to update and if your
  workspace was located inside the previous installation directory, DO
  NOT FORGET TO BACKUP the workspace or it will be lost when the old
  version is deleted.
* If you are upgrading with the ZIP archive: do not unzip the latest
  version on top of the oldest one. You will need to delete the
  previous version before continuing the installation.
* If you are updating with the installer: the installer will
  automatically delete the previous version of Overture and preserve
  your workspace, if it was inside the previous installation
  directory.


Uninstalling
------------

To uninstall Overture, remove the contents of the directory where you
installed it. There are no other files stored on the system (apart
from any workspace files you may have created).

For Windows users, if the Overture installer was used previously, it
is possible to uninstall via the uninstall shortcut created by the
installer in the start programs or via the Uninstall menu in the
Control Panel.

Known Issues
------------

The following issues are already known.  You can find the full list of
Overture bugs at the SourceForge site.  Please check the bug list
before raising new bugs.

* LaTeX coverage files and VDM-RT log files do not correctly handle
  international character encodings.
* Error/warning locations may not be perfect if the source line is
  indented with tabs, or mixtures of tabs and spaces. Similarly, LaTeX
  coverage output does not correctly process tabs.
* If VDM source is embedded in LaTeX, the first line of the file must
  be a LaTeX document, section or subsection command, or a LaTeX
  comment.
* When an execution stops at a breakpoint, the Debug dialogue may not
  open the stack of the current thread, or may focus on the stack of
  another thread.
* Combinatorial testing does not always refresh the results when tests
  are evaluated. Click the Refresh button at the top of the view to
  force a refresh.
* There are several known issues or limitations in the VDMJ
  engine. See the SourceForge bug list for details.
* The output console showing the result of an evaluation, or an error
  raised during evaluation, is not always visible when the evaluation
  completes. Click the "Display Selected Console" button to cycle
  through the consoles available.
* It sometimes takes a long time to generate the GUI representation of
  a VDM-RT log file, and the log files themselves can become quite
  large.
* You may find a Proof Obligation View remains open when you switch
  out of the Proof Obligations perspective. Just close the view.
* When you run a set of combinatorial tests, the coverage of the
  specification is not measured. Individual tests' coverage is
  measured if you "Send to Interpreter".

contact the Overture project and we will try to help.  You can contact
us here:

* email: info@overturetool.org

list, you can create a new bug report.
