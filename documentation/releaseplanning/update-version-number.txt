To update *all* of the version numbers in the pom.xml files all at
once, use this command at the repository root:

$ find . -name "pom.xml" | xargs -n1 sed -i '' -e 's/2.1.1<!--Replaceable: Main Version-->/2.1.2<!--Replaceable: Main Version-->/'

Replace 2.1.1 with the version that it's currently at, and replace
2.1.2 with the version you want it to be.

Make sure you leave the "<!--Replaceable: Main Version-->" portion of
the string in place, otherwise this method will break and Joey will
come after you with sharp, pointy objects.

Note: there is still some version number magic in the MANIFEST.MF and
build.properties files, so be sure to go through them and replace the version numbers appropriately

----

At release, we also need to update 
  ide/build/build.properties 
  ide/platform/src/main/java/org/overture/ide/platform/splash/SplashHandler.java
To make sure that user-visible release number is correct
