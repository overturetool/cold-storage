<p>The vdmj package implements a parser, static type checker, interpreter and
debugger for VDM-SL (the Vienna Development Method Specification Language) and
the object oriented extension called VDM++.</p>

<p>Computing systems may be modelled in VDM at a higher level of abstraction
than is achievable using programming languages, allowing the analysis of designs
and identification of key features, including defects, at an early stage of system
development. Models that have been validated can be transformed into detailed
system designs through a refinement process. The language has a formal semantics,
enabling proof of the properties of models to a high level of assurance. It also
has an executable subset, so that models may be analyzed by testing and can be
executed through graphical user interfaces, so that models can be evaluated by
experts who are not necessarily familiar with the modelling language itself.</p>
